Chapter 4 talked about templating and its importance in building dynamic web applications. 
Firstly, we understood what templating is - a technique used to generate dynamic HTML content by combining static templates with data. 

Next is Jinja templating system, a popular choice for Python web frameworks. Jinja provides a powerful yet straightforward syntax for embedding dynamic data within HTML. 

To see Jinja in action, it is integrated into FastAPI application.


One of the most powerful features of Jinja templating is template inheritance, which promotes code reuse and consistency across multiple pages. 

Next is developing a homepage and a todo list page. The homepage template extended the base template, only modifying the main content block to display a welcome message. Similarly, the todo list template extended the base template and included a form for adding new todo items, as well as a list to display existing items.

By the end of the chapter, i had a solid understanding of how to use Jinja templates to create dynamic and maintainable web applications with FastAPI.
