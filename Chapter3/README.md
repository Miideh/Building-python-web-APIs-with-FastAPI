Chapter 3 talked about the foundational concepts of responses and response models, which are crucial for building robust and efficient web APIs. 

Responses and Response Models: Responses are the information that a server sends back to the client after processing a request. In the context of web APIs, it's essential to structure these responses in a way that clients can easily understand and use. 
HTTP Status Codes:HTTP status codes are standardized codes that indicate the result of an HTTP request. They inform the client about the success or failure of the request and provide additional context for troubleshooting. Common status codes include:
200 OK:The request was successful.
201 Created:The request was successful.
400 Bad Request:The request was invalid.
404 Not Found:The requested resource could not be found.
500 Internal Server Error

Understanding and using the appropriate status codes is important for effective error handling and communication in APIs.

Creating Response Models:Building on the knowledge of models from the previous chapter,response model was created to streamline and standardize the API responses. 

Error Handling:Proper error handling is important for creating resilient APIs. It involves detecting, managing, and responding to errors in a way that minimizes disruption and provides meaningful feedback to the client.
