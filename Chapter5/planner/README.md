Chapter 5 explains how to structure a FastAPI application effectively to enhance development speed, debugging efficiency, and overall productivity.

Structuring the Application

i began by understanding the importance of a well-organized application. The first task was to create a new folder for the application, named planner, and within it, i created subfolders for database, routes, and models, along with an entry file, main.py. Each folder was set up with an __init__.py file to ensure Python treats them as packages.

Designing the Planner API

The goal was to build an event planner application, where registered users can create, update, and delete events. The application structure included specific files for handling routing and model definitions:
Routes: events.py and users.py in the routes folder handle various routing operations, such as event management and user registration.
Models: events.py and users.py in the models folder define the data structures and validation schemas for events and users.

Implementing Models

i started by defining models for events and users. These models describe how data is stored, inputted, and represented in the application. The  Event model included fields like title, image banner, description, tags, and location. The User model included email, password, and a list of events created by the user. i also defined a Config subclass to provide example data for API documentation.

Setting Up Routing

Next, i moved on to implementing the routing system of our API, designing routes for user and event operations.
User Routes: i set up routes for sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out operations, ensuring that each user action was handled efficiently. The routes checked for existing users before adding new ones and validated credentials during sign-in.
Event Routes: i implemented routes to create, update, and delete events. These routes handled event operations, including fetching all events or specific events by ID.

Testing and Documentation

After setting up the routes, i registered them in main.py and started our application using uvicorn. i also tested the user routes by signing up and signing in users, ensuring that the operations performed as expected. i also leveraged FastAPIâ€™s interactive documentation, powered by Swagger, to view and test our routes easily.
